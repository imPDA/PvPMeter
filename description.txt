[SIZE="5"][COLOR="Lime"]"Look at these Impressive Stats!"[/COLOR][/SIZE]

This addon is inspired by PvP Meter (by marig63). Some features of the original addon stopped working after an in-game update long ago and were subsequently disabled by the current maintainer (amuridee). The goal of this addon is to replace the missing features and provide a more user-friendly and feature-rich interface.
