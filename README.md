# PvP Meter \[BETA\]

This addon inspired by [PvP Meter](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1760-PvpMeter.html) (by [marig63](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?action=getinfo&userid=33782)). Some features of original addon stopped working after in-game update long ago and then was turned off by current maintainer - [amuridee](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?action=getinfo&userid=46671). The goal of my addon is to replace missing features and add more user friendly and reach interface.

## Main features

- **Fully reworked** codebase, I only tried to match an original design
- **Battlegrounds**, **Duels** and **Tales Of Tribute** card game supported 
- **Filters** by character/opponent/game types and so on
- LibAsync to prevent from freezing on list update (tested up to **1M duels** loaded at once)
- PerfectPixel support

### Battlegrounds
- list of all matches with essential information
- 3 filers: for team size (4 or 8), match type (deathmatch, crazy king an so on) and for playable character (can choose form one to all your characters)
- when first time logged on any character, they selected by default, then your choice will be saved (per character)
- button to select/deselect all characters
- simple statistics with winrate and KDA which takes into considiraion all applied filters
